OK, so I want to build a mostly client-side typescript website that is able to manage pickleball play sessions.
It should do the following:
* Support a king of the court mode
* Support a round-robin mode
-- The round-robin mode should try to maximize the number of different people you play with in the least amount of games.
* Support doubles sessions 
* Support Singles Sessions
* Support a teams session where players are locked together the entire time, and only their opponents change
* Support having an uneven number of players, and having people wait for games. -- It should be as fair as possible with choosing who waits so that people don't have to wait repeatedly
* Have a way to input a list of players for a session
* Support adding/removing players from a session dynamically
* Have a nice UI that shows where each player will play 
* Have a queue system that waits for an open court and then assigns players to the court when it's free
* Have a UI where users can input the score for a game when it is finished
* Support banning potential team pairs for people that don't want to play together
* 

The website should have a robust unit test suite for all the capabilites that are built.





### Revision 2
Great start! Some major changes are required. We need to be able to see a list of players, and dynamically add
   and remove players (some might come later, or leave the session early) -- we need to be able to forfeit a game --
   which will be like that combination of players played, but there will be no saved results. We also need to remove
   the "Start Next Round" capabilities, don't think of it as having rounds, think of it as a continuous queue of
   games, everytime scores are input, the global state is re-evaluated and more games are made as possible.
   
### Revision 3
 This is great, is there a way we can see a history of all games played easily? We should also be able to edit the
   scores of those historical games if there was a mistake. Also, for the courts being displayed, can we have Team 1 be
    boxed in the left, Team 2 being boxed on the right, and the controls & score input in the middle between them?
   Right now it's top to bottom which is a little weird.
