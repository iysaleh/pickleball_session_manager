OK, so I want to build a mostly client-side typescript website that is able to manage pickleball play sessions.
It should do the following:
* Support a king of the court mode
* Support a round-robin mode
-- The round-robin mode should try to maximize the number of different people you play with in the least amount of games.
* Support doubles sessions 
* Support Singles Sessions
* Support a teams session where players are locked together the entire time, and only their opponents change
* Support having an uneven number of players, and having people wait for games. -- It should be as fair as possible with choosing who waits so that people don't have to wait repeatedly
* Have a way to input a list of players for a session
* Support adding/removing players from a session dynamically
* Have a nice UI that shows where each player will play 
* Have a queue system that waits for an open court and then assigns players to the court when it's free
* Have a UI where users can input the score for a game when it is finished
* Support banning potential team pairs for people that don't want to play together
* 

The website should have a robust unit test suite for all the capabilites that are built.





### Revision 2
Great start! Some major changes are required. We need to be able to see a list of players, and dynamically add
   and remove players (some might come later, or leave the session early) -- we need to be able to forfeit a game --
   which will be like that combination of players played, but there will be no saved results. We also need to remove
   the "Start Next Round" capabilities, don't think of it as having rounds, think of it as a continuous queue of
   games, everytime scores are input, the global state is re-evaluated and more games are made as possible.
   
### Revision 3
 This is great, is there a way we can see a history of all games played easily? We should also be able to edit the
   scores of those historical games if there was a mistake. Also, for the courts being displayed, can we have Team 1 be
    boxed in the left, Team 2 being boxed on the right, and the controls & score input in the middle between them?
   Right now it's top to bottom which is a little weird.
   
### Revision 4

It's a little annoying entering a bunch of test player names everytime I want to try this out, can you give me a
   special button if I access the site with a query param like ?test=true , the special button adds 18 players with
   first and last names.
   
### Revision 5

This is great. Some improvements if you please:
* Everytime you complete a game on a court, all the court positions change, they should stay static, and always numbers logically in ascending order.
* We need to see the history of every game that was every played on each court, not just the last game on a court
* The team boxes aren't always rendering correctly in the Court box, they are overflowing -- can you fix that?

### Revision 6
* If I click End session, all the players are lost -- we need an Edit session button as well, that lets us keep the players that we already added, but just change the mode or court configuration that we're playing.

### Revision 7
* It's hard to see the numbers in the score boxes, make the score font smaller. 
* Scores like 5-5 are not valid, but I am allowed to submit them and it shows a winner/loser. A winner must have a score higher than the loser.
* If I add a player after the session started, that player never gets rotated in. They should actually be the first rotation in!

### Revision 8
* Scores in the history are hard to see, they should just be a text box, don't render the up-down arrow to increase/decrease.
* If I show history and finish a game, I need to hide & show history again for it to redraw -- fix it so that it auto redraws history.
* Make sure that history is chronological -- the game that most recently finished should be at the top.
* Make it so that history is shown by default. 

### Revision 9
* Please add a dark mode/light mode toggle, and make dark mode the default.

### Revision 10
* The text is a little hard to read -- black on very dark grey doesn't work. Use a more visible dark color scheme...
* Round robin mode is very deterministic -- We should be able to know exactly what games we have scheduled once we start a session --- and when we add a player, we should be able to recalculate all the future sessions immediately. Add a show queue button that shows the next scheduled games -- it should show the next 10 by default for round robin (and maybe even make it a paged area so a user can go forward or backwards by clicking arrow buttons). Make the number of games that it shows on page configurable, like the number of courts per row is configurable.
* For King of the court mode, we need to wait and see who wins and loses the current games before we can queue the next ones, so that logic needs to function differently. We don't want to queue a game as soon as one finishes, because we want this to function in more of a bracketed/rounds format.

### Revision 11
*The player tags that you can add or remove still have black text on dark backgrounds, that still needs to be updated with a more visible color scheme.
*The Match Queue currently renders above the Active Courts box, it should render below the Active Courts box.
* Inside of the Active Courts box, the score boxes still have the up/down arrows, we don't need that, they can just be text input boxes like in the Match History box.
* Matches per Page have the up/down arrows, we don't need those there either, just have it be a plain text input box.

### Revision 12
* The Active Courts box is now rendering below the match history and match queue elements. That's not good, Active Courts needs to be at the top, then Match Queue below it, then Match History below Match Queue, and Player Statistics all the way at the bottom...

### Revision 13
* When I click show Queue, the button doesn't change to "Hide Queue" -- it stays "Show Queue" -- make sure the toggle is working correctly, and the queue starts as visible
* When I click Edit Session, Match Queue stays visible on the Session Setup page, that shouldn't happen.
* Match queue is only showing 3 games for round robin -- it can technically show infinite sessions, so please calculate up to the max needed to fill the specified Matches per Page configuration (which is 10 by default). For this reason, Page x of x doesn't make sense, it should just show the current page number.
 
### Revision 14
* In the match queue, games number 1 & 6 have the same players, also 2 & 7 have the same players. The round robin queue system is clearly not calculating the queue correctly. 

### Revision 15
* When I click end session the match queue is visible on the session setup, but there is no longer an active session, so there shouldn't be any match queue!
* Instead of having the added players appear as floating tiles/buttons/elements, the added players should display as a numbered list (we still need to be able to remove them by pressing the red X next to their name)
* Player statistics needs to update automatically every time a game completes -- currently, it only updates when I hide and show statistics.

### Revision 15.5
* For the players list on the session setup page, please make sure each entry in the list has a visible number, EG 1. James Anderson
* If possible, please make the numbered list span multiple columns so it doesn't take so much space.
* The players list should display as a multi-column list on the Active Session page the same way that it shows up in the Session Setup Page

### Revision 15.6
* Not quite there yet, There are no visible numbers next to the play names. I just see names like "James Anderson" or "Sarah Mitchell", but it should be a numbered list, EG "1. James Anderson" "2. Sarah Mitchell". 
* Also, it's all just one long list, I need it to span multiple columns, lets do 3 columns.

### Revision 15.7
* It is now multi-column, but it still doesn't have numbers displayed next to the name yet. Also, the 3 columns only
   take up like half the page, it should auto fill the space it has -- if possible, maybe make it a variable number of
   columns depending on the width.
   
   
### Revision 16
* When I press start session, the Match Queue shows empty. It doesn't render until I click Next and then Previous.
* The columns are a little bit tough to distinguish, Please add some styling so that every other column has some sligthly different shading to differentiate them.

### Revision 17
* We calculate a ton of queued matches at the start, which makes loading a new session or adding a player pretty slow. Can we limit it so that we only calculate 100 matches in advance and then stop (make this 100 matches configurable in the UI). We should recalculate again once we add or remove a player or the number of matches in queue reaches 80% of the 100 configured number.

### Revision 17.1
* Perfect! The Max Queue Size configuration needs to be on the Session Setup page as well.

### Revision 17.2
* It's kind of an advanced / admin control. Can we have a separate "Advanced Config" subpage that we open by pressing a button on the Session Setup page? It should just be an icon that only pro users know to click.

### Revision 18
* The round robin algorithm doesn't seem like it maximizes the amount of different players people play with as soon as possible. Instead, players seem to play with the same other players with minimal variations. Please create a test suite and test cases for the round robin algorithm used so that we get as much variation as in as few games as possible. Make sure the function used in the test suite are the same functions used in the actual code.

### Revision 18.1
* I see this, 1st game court 1: Team1: "James Anderson" "Sarah Mitchell" Team 2: "Michael Chen" "Emily Rodrigues", Then 4th game in Queue is: Team 1: "James Anderson" "Michael Chen" Team 2: "Sarah Mitchell" "Emily Rodrigues"  --- There are 18 players in this session, there is no reason why These same 4 people should be playing again so soon, just with a little variation in the teams. Please improve the tests and algorithm to ensure more player diversity early on.

### Revision 18.2
* Ooof this is bad, in an 18 player game with 2 courts available, player #17 and #18 don't play until Game #21... Something is still seriously wrong with this algorithm. 


### Revision 19
* Please now build tests for the king of the court algorithm, make sure the algorithm attempts to have :
** Equal play time: Every player should get roughly the same number of games (no one sitting too long).
** Avoid long idle times: The algorithm should minimize players waiting multiple rounds in a row.
** Variety of opponents: Players should face as many different people as possible (not the same group repeatedly). -- but winning opponents should face winning opponents as much as possible.
** Partner diversity (for doubles): Try to maximize the variety of partners over the session.
** Promotion and demotion logic: Winners move up, losers move down (classic King of the Court format) -- there can be some leeway in this to achieve other algorithm goals.
** Graceful handling of uneven outcomes: If a player sits out or leaves, the algorithm should rebalance smoothly.
** Deterministic scheduling: Given the same results, it should produce the same next-round assignments.

### Revision 19.1
* Please tune and fix the king of the court algorithm...  If we need for matches to finish before we can determine the next
    round, make sure we add support for that logic.

### Revision 20
* When I start a King of the Court match, my courts just sit there "Waiting for Players..." Something isn't working right... Also, it says "Queue is only available for Round-Robin mode... But there should be a queue for king of the court, it's just not 100% predetermined.

### Revision 20.1
* After I input all the scores, I have to click "Start Next Round" --- Can we have it automatically start the next round when all the scores are inputted for that round?

### Revision 21
* Teams is considered a game mode, but really you can have Team Round Robin and Team King of the Court. Rework Team logic, make sure you can add 2 players as a team when doing Team Round Robin or Team King of the Court --- If algorithm reuse for round robin and king of the court is possible, we should try to implement that --- Also, verify all the existing tests work after this change.

### Revision 21.1
* This logic works, but it's clunky... Adding players then making them a team is tedious, When Locked Teams is selected, make it so that we add players as a team (IE Two inputs for players that will be together). -- With this way of working, we don't need players displayed and teams displayed in two different areas, we just need the teams displayed.

### Revision 21.2
* Give me a test function, like "Add 18 Test Players", but instead have it be "Add 9 Teams".

### Revision 22
* Add a current rankings button during a session that ranks all the players from best to worst... First rank players by total number of wins -- handle ties by giving a higher rank to the player with the better average point differential in all their games. 
* Make sure you also write tests for these ranking features.

### Revision 23
* For locked team sessions, make sure the Current Session page shows the locked teams rather than individual players -- The same as it is in the SEssion Setup Page
* For team sessions, A team gets 1st, 2nd, 3rd --- not the individual players -- make sure the ranking component updates to show the team together, not the player.

### Revision 24
* We don't want a player that gets added late to a game to essentially never wait because other people have played 2-3 games already, so it makes the most since that a player that gets added later should have their wait status = the max waited by the person that has waited the most so far + 1. Please implement that. (Also, wait times should apply to teams as a whole in team mode)
* When team mode is enabled, make sure you can dynamically add and remove teams in the active session page. 

### Revision 25
* Please update the favicon to be the tennis/pickleball icon so it shows that way in the browser address bar and window
* Please update the app so that the current state is saved locally in the browsers data -- If a user does a refresh or a hard-refresh, all the current data should stay. Please add a "Clear Current Session Configuration" in the Sessions Control page to be able to purge the local browser data cache for this site.

### Revision 26
* Make "Show Rankings" a Closable Pop-Up window, instead of an element on the page that we have to scroll down to see
* Change the default number of courts to 4 instead of 2

### Revision 26.1
* Also make "Show Statistics" a Closable Pop-Up window like "Show Rankings" is now.

### Revision 26.2
* Move "Show History" next to the "Show Queue" Button. The button Order should be: "Show Queue" "Show History" Show Rankings" "Show Statistics" "Edit Session" "Clear Session Data" "End Session".

### Revision 26.3
* Rename "Edit Session" to "Edit Session Config"

### Revision 27
* Courts elements in the Active Courts box can overflow the screen, and there is no way to scroll if that happens. Either make it scrollable, or make the elements autofit. 

### Revision 27.1
* The problem is when the courts overflow in the screen width, there is now left-right scroll bar. I have no problem with the vertical scrollability.

### Revision 28
* I want to release this as a github page so that anybody can go to the link and use it. Will that work? Or is there is server component that is required? If it works, what changes do I need?

### Revision 29
* Please build comprehensive UI tests that run in a local browser.

### Revision 29.1
* Go ahead and run the UI tests, and fixup any that are broken

### Revision 29.2
* How come all the tests passed, but running npx -y vite@latest didn't work? Should we add a test for basic dev startup?


### Revision 30
* 7 of the Playwright tests failed, are you able to run the tests yourself, get the error output, and fix them?

### Revision 30.1
* Can you write me a simple script that runs all the tests? (E2E, Round Robin, and King of the Court Tests)

### Revision 30.2
* 'npm run test:all' doesn't work, try it yourself and fix any issues with it: npm run test:all

### Revision 30.2
* Excellent, please run and fix all failing tests (including timing tests)

### Revision 30.3
* How do I run the king of the court tests? Also, there are lots of failures with  `npm test run`, fix them please. Especially make sure all the unit tests run and pass for the round-robin and king of the court algorithms.

### Revision 31
* I have now purchased the domain `BetterPickleballSessions.com` -- please make the necessary updates to support this domain. Also, do any necessary App title renaming for Better Pickleball Sessions. 
* Add a single-page-app type navigation bar at the top that allows users to change between session controls for setup, the current active session, a page explaining the different modes and configurations, and an about page. PLease create the missing pages.

### Revision 31.1
* Beautiful, but just a few tiny bugs, when you click start session, the "Active Session" button doesn't become highlighted, the "Setup" button stays highlighted.
** Also, you shouldn't be able to start a session if there is already an active session. 

### Revision 31.2
* When you switch between the tabs, the logic for Hide/Show Queue and Hide/Show history doesn't work properly, it's indicating that it's already being showed, but it's not until you hide and show it again for both the queue and history.
* Review the king of the court algorithm and the Modes & Config description page, does what's described there actually match the algorithm? I don't think the algorithm is about moving up (atleast it shouldn't be), it's about winners playing winners, the court number the game is played on is irrelevant. (atleast that's how it should be)

### Revision 32
* Currently the King of the Court algorithm uses a strict round-based system. All rounds must finish before a new game is scheduled. But that's not really necessary -- we can have more of a continuous flow. Once 2 games finish, or 1 game finishes and we have 2 people waiting, we can immediately schedule the next game because we know who the winners are. Update the king of the court algorithm to be more continuous and less strict round based. Also, make sure you run and fix any tests that rely on this.

### Revision 32.1
* I think you broke king of the court --- now the courts finish all the matches scheduled at the start, and no new matches are ever scheduled, every just shows as waiting to play in the match queue (they're not even properly showing in the "Waiting Players" queue)... Something is wrong.

### Revision 32.2
* Continuous flow works now, but the problem is that we never wait for other courts to finish -- we are always scheduling a game with available players. That means we are not getting enough variation in the games played -- and the same players constantly play each other. We need to keep the big picture when scheduling games, it's OK to wait for 2 courts to finish before scheduling games. This is tricky, please think hard about a good algorithm to achieve this behavior. People who have only won games should probably never play against people who have only lost games. 

### Revision 32.3
* We're still not there yet, if I test this by only finishing games on court 1 with 2 people waiting, and never finish games on court 2,3,4, court 1 will still continuously get populated with games --- causing a lack of match variety. We need to have a court wait for other courts to finish when the same players have played in games with each other more than other players have already.

### Revision 32.4
* I don't think shouldWaitForBetterMatchups is happening, if I test this by only finishing games on court 1 with noone waiting, court 1 is just constantly populated by the same players playing against each other!


### Revision 32.5
* The algorithm has winning players playing with losing players to keep the flow going, that shouldn't happen. We
   need to wait for other courts to finish, and let some player variety kick in!!!!!
* Rework the algorithm to use the current rankings system, people should only ever play games that are close to them in rankings (if there are 18 players, there should only be 9 players that someone can ever play a game with -- IE 50% of the player pool) -- The #1 ranked player should only ever be able to play games with up to the #9 ranked player in an 18 player game. And the #18 ranked player should only ever be able to play games with up to the #10 ranked player. Have hard locks on this rule -- do not immediately schedule games if this condition is not met!!! Of course, we need special handling for players that haven't played any games at all. Add handling so that it prioritizes games with people closely ranked together -- especially if they haven't played together yet. EG, ideally, #16, #17, #18, #19 ranked players play together if possible. We need to also update the ranking so that somebody with a low win rate winning against someone with a low win rate/ranking doesn't push them to the top --- the value of a win needs to be based on some logarithmic function --- not just a straight wins-loss comparison. Please Think extra special about this algorithm, it's imperative that we get it right. Make sure we don't just rush to make games, its OK to wait for better games. 

### Revision 32.6
* Running the dev server fails with an HTML parse5 error, please fix: `npx -y vite@latest`

### Revision 32.7
* The hard lock on players only being able to play within 50% of the player pool by order of rankings is simply not working -- it's immediately scheduling a court after a game finishes regardless of ranking. Please fix!

### Revision 33
* Once we click Start Session, all session configuration options need to become un-editable until the current active session is ended. We should be able to end the current session from the Setup page (please add an "End Session" button there as well). 

### Revision 33.1
* You can still remove players for an active session on the Setup page, but nothing happens --- you shouldn't be able to remove players there when a session is active.
* Please have 2 buttons while a session is active: "End Session and Clear Data", "End Session and Keep Players"

### Revision 33.2
* When you remove a player from the Active Session page, it should also remove the same player from the Setup page, but that doesn't happen now. 

### Revision 34
* In the about page, Add a link to the github repository for this https://github.com/iysaleh/pickleball_session_manager . Mention that it's open source and to report issues, bugs or feature requests there.

### Revision 35
* Adding a player to an active session doesn't add the player to the Session Setup page --- it should. If you end a session but keep the players after adding a player, any players added after the initial setup should be present in the setup page.
* In King of the Court mode, There's an extra waiting players section within the Match Queue -- sometimes players correctly show up there, but not in the "Waiting Players" Area. There shouldn't be a second waiting players section within the Match Queue, "Waiting Players" should be updated with king of the court waiting players logic when another needs to finish before the next games can be scheduled.

### Revision 36
* For king of the court, We can still run into a situation where players that are similarly skilled can continually play games against or with each other... This is no fun. Put a hard cap at playing 1 game with the same players (on the same team) for every (total-players/4) games. We can wait for other courts to finish to get more games (assuming there are other courts). Put the same cap for the against each other portion. (or is there another solution you can think of to make this better?)

### Revision 36.1
* We have too many empty courts at any one time now, and it's possible to make it impossible to meet these new strict match conditions. We need to ease up the requirements.

### Revision 37
* Can we show and sort by the score that's actually being used in king of the court to arrange games in the "Show Rankings" page?

### Revision 38
* In show statistics, games played includes the current game that is not finished. That is not correct. It should only include completed games.

### Revision 39
* In King of the Court, I hate it where we have a game where players A B are against C D, and then the next game is with players A C vs D B ... Please add hard restrictions against back to back games with the same exact players.

### Revision 39.1
* Add a button to export the match history and current matches configuration in a simple text format (also include the current waiting players)

### Revision 39.2
* Look at this match history and current court setup @pickleball-session-11-03-2025-15-00.txt -- Player Ibraheem is against Leslie, even though she has lost every game, and he has won every game! That should never happen!!! Analyze what went wrong with the algorithm and fix it, and then add a manual test to avoid this from ever happening again.

### Revision 39.3
* Look at this match history and current court setup @pickleball-session-11-03-2025-15-05.txt --- Ibraheem is playing with players 14 and 2 again so soon, with just player 9 being new. That's not enough variety. Expand the back-to-back hard matchmaking limitation to prevent 3 of the same players from playing back-to-back as well.

### Revision 40
* Do all of these improvements to the king of the court algorithm also apply to locked teams mode, or do we need updates to support that?

### Revision 41
* Do the Rankings and Statistics been updated for teams so that we see team based information? Or is it still indvidual?

### Revision 41.1
*Look at the team session for @pickleball-session-11-03-2025-15-19.txt , At the start of the session, we had more than enough teams to make a match, but only 2 courts are filled!!! Something is seriously wrong. Fix it, and add a test so it doesn't happen again.

### Revision 42
* The site is no longer functional at https://betterpickleballsessions.com/

### Revision 43
* SEO Optimization

### Revision 44
* With 3 people waiting in the "Players Waiting" queue (IE 19 people in a 4 court setup), you can end up with cases with a small amount of player variety. Augment the king of the court algorithm to occassionally wait for 2 courts to finish even when it can technically schedule a game now, just to increase game matchup variety. Look at how often players 1 & 2 played against each other due to the lack of waiting in this session: @pickleball-session-11-04-2025-13-54.txt --- please minimize this effect.

### Revision 45
* When I click Start Session, the courts are populated in the order that players were added. Add an advanced configuration option that uses a random seed of the players instead. Disable it by default.

### Revision 46
* Please add the current game mode to the Active Session page after the Session Controls label, EG "Session Controls - King of the Court" or "Session Controls - Round Robin"

### Revision 47
* We need to augment both round robin and king of the court modes to keep track of which courts finish... If, for example, the same 2 courts finish twice before the other courts finish once, then we should wait until the other court finishes and then make a court. Every court needs to have an individual mix threshold counter. The waitlist should count as a court (the formula #waitlisted/4 should be used to determine how many courts the waitlist counts as, for example, if we have 8 players on the waitlist, that's 2 courts of diversity.) We need to slowly expand and decrease a variety counter. Keep track of which courts mixed with each courts last -- never mix with the same courts twice in a row, have them wait for another court to open, then mix all 3 courts (making the most balanced games possible).

### Revision 47.1
* Remember to treat the waitlist like a court, put a hard cap on the same courts mixing 2 times in a row.

### Revision TODO
* King of the Court doesn't really make sense for 4 players, but I tried it anyways. After 3 games, there were no more games to play and all 4 players just sat there waiting. Is something wrong with the algorithm? Shouldn't it never end, regardless of the configuration?
* Please add a test for 20 players and make sure the algorithm continues to work for 400 games, make the winners random...








* I want to make a new game mode called "Competetive Matchmaking Variety", we will build the algorithm for this piece by piece. Please build the shell for this new game mode, but since we don't have anything yet for it, it should just never make any courts when a new match is started.
* At the start of competetive matchmaking variety, we just take up to the first numberOfEmptyCourts*4 available players from the waitlist and make those courts.
* Please rename everything for Competetive Matchmaking Variety to Competetive Variety Matchmaking
* The first feature I want to build for competetive variety matchmaking mode is a simple court variety algorithm... Consider each court as an entity, and the wait list as an entity. Courts may never make a game with the same four players that just played on the court (We assume the minimum players using competetive variety matchmaking is 10). After each match finishes, courts must mix with another court or the waitlist -- and we keep track of which courts just mixed with what court. For example, if court 1 finishes, all players must wait until another court (EG court 2) finishes. Then when another court finishes (or there are players in the wait list), 2 players are swapped from each court. If there is only 1 player on the waitlist, that court does not get made (there must be a minimum of 2 players in the waitlist for court mixing with the waitlist to happen). Consider the waitlist as multiple 4 unit groups that get tracked for this variety algorithm separately. EG, if there are 16 players and 2 courts, the waitlist will have 8 players (considered as 2 groups that mix separately for this variety algorithm). In 3+ court situations where there are enough players to fill them, we have a rule that courts may never mix with the same court (and waitlist) back to back. EG if courts 1 & 2 finish, and mix swapping players to fill themselves for the next game. If they finish again, they may not mix again, and players must return to the waitlist after the game finishes, and the court will be unoccupied until another court finishes. Once courts mix with a different court, we reset the court back to back tracking for all courts that had previously been blocked from being made. I'm sure there are some simple scenarios I forgot in writing this, but the overall idea to ensure match variety is there. Please build this feature, thinking comprehensively about what needs to be better for different scenarios.



* We want to build a variety component to competetive variety matchmaking. The first feature I want to build for competetive variety matchmaking mode is a simple variety algorithm... Keep track of each court that a player has last played on. The same 4 players may never make a game together on any court after having just played together. (We assume the minimum players using competetive variety matchmaking is 10). After each match finishes, players must mix with players that played on another court or that haven't played at all -- We must keep track of the courts that players just mixed together with. For example, if court 1 finishes, all players must wait until another court (EG court 2) finishes. Then when another court finishes (or there are players in the wait list), 2 players are swapped from each court. If there is only 1 player on the waitlist, that court does not get made (there must be a minimum of 2 players in the waitlist for mixing with the waitlist to happen). Prefer to mix with players that haven't played on any court yet before mixing with players that have previously played on a court. In 3+ full court situations (12+ players total), we have a rule that courts may never mix with players from the same court back to back. EG if courts 1 & 2 finish, and mix swapping players to fill themselves for the next game and then if they finish again, they may not mix again and the court will be unoccupied until another court finishes (EG court #3, #4, etc). I'm sure there are some simple scenarios I forgot in writing this, but the overall idea to ensure match variety is there. Please build this feature, thinking comprehensively about what needs to be better for different scenarios.



* In situations where we have 3+ active courts, after players from 2 courts mix once, we don't want them to mix again until atleast one other court has finished their session and are waiting.
