OK, so I want to build a mostly client-side typescript website that is able to manage pickleball play sessions.
It should do the following:
* Support a king of the court mode
* Support a round-robin mode
-- The round-robin mode should try to maximize the number of different people you play with in the least amount of games.
* Support doubles sessions 
* Support Singles Sessions
* Support a teams session where players are locked together the entire time, and only their opponents change
* Support having an uneven number of players, and having people wait for games. -- It should be as fair as possible with choosing who waits so that people don't have to wait repeatedly
* Have a way to input a list of players for a session
* Support adding/removing players from a session dynamically
* Have a nice UI that shows where each player will play 
* Have a queue system that waits for an open court and then assigns players to the court when it's free
* Have a UI where users can input the score for a game when it is finished
* Support banning potential team pairs for people that don't want to play together
* 

The website should have a robust unit test suite for all the capabilites that are built.





### Revision 2
Great start! Some major changes are required. We need to be able to see a list of players, and dynamically add
   and remove players (some might come later, or leave the session early) -- we need to be able to forfeit a game --
   which will be like that combination of players played, but there will be no saved results. We also need to remove
   the "Start Next Round" capabilities, don't think of it as having rounds, think of it as a continuous queue of
   games, everytime scores are input, the global state is re-evaluated and more games are made as possible.
   
### Revision 3
 This is great, is there a way we can see a history of all games played easily? We should also be able to edit the
   scores of those historical games if there was a mistake. Also, for the courts being displayed, can we have Team 1 be
    boxed in the left, Team 2 being boxed on the right, and the controls & score input in the middle between them?
   Right now it's top to bottom which is a little weird.
   
### Revision 4

It's a little annoying entering a bunch of test player names everytime I want to try this out, can you give me a
   special button if I access the site with a query param like ?test=true , the special button adds 18 players with
   first and last names.
   
### Revision 5

This is great. Some improvements if you please:
* Everytime you complete a game on a court, all the court positions change, they should stay static, and always numbers logically in ascending order.
* We need to see the history of every game that was every played on each court, not just the last game on a court
* The team boxes aren't always rendering correctly in the Court box, they are overflowing -- can you fix that?

### Revision 6
* If I click End session, all the players are lost -- we need an Edit session button as well, that lets us keep the players that we already added, but just change the mode or court configuration that we're playing.

### Revision 7
* It's hard to see the numbers in the score boxes, make the score font smaller. 
* Scores like 5-5 are not valid, but I am allowed to submit them and it shows a winner/loser. A winner must have a score higher than the loser.
* If I add a player after the session started, that player never gets rotated in. They should actually be the first rotation in!

### Revision 8
* Scores in the history are hard to see, they should just be a text box, don't render the up-down arrow to increase/decrease.
* If I show history and finish a game, I need to hide & show history again for it to redraw -- fix it so that it auto redraws history.
* Make sure that history is chronological -- the game that most recently finished should be at the top.
* Make it so that history is shown by default. 

### Revision 9
* Please add a dark mode/light mode toggle, and make dark mode the default.

### Revision 10
* The text is a little hard to read -- black on very dark grey doesn't work. Use a more visible dark color scheme...
* Round robin mode is very deterministic -- We should be able to know exactly what games we have scheduled once we start a session --- and when we add a player, we should be able to recalculate all the future sessions immediately. Add a show queue button that shows the next scheduled games -- it should show the next 10 by default for round robin (and maybe even make it a paged area so a user can go forward or backwards by clicking arrow buttons). Make the number of games that it shows on page configurable, like the number of courts per row is configurable.
* For King of the court mode, we need to wait and see who wins and loses the current games before we can queue the next ones, so that logic needs to function differently. We don't want to queue a game as soon as one finishes, because we want this to function in more of a bracketed/rounds format.

### Revision 11
*The player tags that you can add or remove still have black text on dark backgrounds, that still needs to be updated with a more visible color scheme.
*The Match Queue currently renders above the Active Courts box, it should render below the Active Courts box.
* Inside of the Active Courts box, the score boxes still have the up/down arrows, we don't need that, they can just be text input boxes like in the Match History box.
* Matches per Page have the up/down arrows, we don't need those there either, just have it be a plain text input box.

### Revision 12
* The Active Courts box is now rendering below the match history and match queue elements. That's not good, Active Courts needs to be at the top, then Match Queue below it, then Match History below Match Queue, and Player Statistics all the way at the bottom...

### Revision 13
* When I click show Queue, the button doesn't change to "Hide Queue" -- it stays "Show Queue" -- make sure the toggle is working correctly, and the queue starts as visible
* When I click Edit Session, Match Queue stays visible on the Session Setup page, that shouldn't happen.
* Match queue is only showing 3 games for round robin -- it can technically show infinite sessions, so please calculate up to the max needed to fill the specified Matches per Page configuration (which is 10 by default). For this reason, Page x of x doesn't make sense, it should just show the current page number.
 
### Revision 14
* In the match queue, games number 1 & 6 have the same players, also 2 & 7 have the same players. The round robin queue system is clearly not calculating the queue correctly. 

### Revision 15
* When I click end session the match queue is visible on the session setup, but there is no longer an active session, so there shouldn't be any match queue!
* Instead of having the added players appear as floating tiles/buttons/elements, the added players should display as a numbered list (we still need to be able to remove them by pressing the red X next to their name)
* Player statistics needs to update automatically every time a game completes -- currently, it only updates when I hide and show statistics.

### Revision 15.5
* For the players list on the session setup page, please make sure each entry in the list has a visible number, EG 1. James Anderson
* If possible, please make the numbered list span multiple columns so it doesn't take so much space.
* The players list should display as a multi-column list on the Active Session page the same way that it shows up in the Session Setup Page

### Revision 15.6
* Not quite there yet, There are no visible numbers next to the play names. I just see names like "James Anderson" or "Sarah Mitchell", but it should be a numbered list, EG "1. James Anderson" "2. Sarah Mitchell". 
* Also, it's all just one long list, I need it to span multiple columns, lets do 3 columns.

### Revision 15.7
* It is now multi-column, but it still doesn't have numbers displayed next to the name yet. Also, the 3 columns only
   take up like half the page, it should auto fill the space it has -- if possible, maybe make it a variable number of
   columns depending on the width.
   
   
### Revision 16
* When I press start session, the Match Queue shows empty. It doesn't render until I click Next and then Previous.
* The columns are a little bit tough to distinguish, Please add some styling so that every other column has some sligthly different shading to differentiate them.

### Revision 17
* We calculate a ton of queued matches at the start, which makes loading a new session or adding a player pretty slow. Can we limit it so that we only calculate 100 matches in advance and then stop (make this 100 matches configurable in the UI). We should recalculate again once we add or remove a player or the number of matches in queue reaches 80% of the 100 configured number.

### Revision 17.1
* Perfect! The Max Queue Size configuration needs to be on the Session Setup page as well.

### Revision 17.2
* It's kind of an advanced / admin control. Can we have a separate "Advanced Config" subpage that we open by pressing a button on the Session Setup page? It should just be an icon that only pro users know to click.

### Revision 18
* The round robin algorithm doesn't seem like it maximizes the amount of different players people play with as soon as possible. Instead, players seem to play with the same other players with minimal variations. Please create a test suite and test cases for the round robin algorithm used so that we get as much variation as in as few games as possible. Make sure the function used in the test suite are the same functions used in the actual code.

### Revision 18.1
* I see this, 1st game court 1: Team1: "James Anderson" "Sarah Mitchell" Team 2: "Michael Chen" "Emily Rodrigues", Then 4th game in Queue is: Team 1: "James Anderson" "Michael Chen" Team 2: "Sarah Mitchell" "Emily Rodrigues"  --- There are 18 players in this session, there is no reason why These same 4 people should be playing again so soon, just with a little variation in the teams. Please improve the tests and algorithm to ensure more player diversity early on.

### Revision 18.2
* Ooof this is bad, in an 18 player game with 2 courts available, player #17 and #18 don't play until Game #21... Something is still seriously wrong with this algorithm. 


### Revision 19
* Please now build tests for the king of the court algorithm, make sure the algorithm attempts to have :
** Equal play time: Every player should get roughly the same number of games (no one sitting too long).
** Avoid long idle times: The algorithm should minimize players waiting multiple rounds in a row.
** Variety of opponents: Players should face as many different people as possible (not the same group repeatedly). -- but winning opponents should face winning opponents as much as possible.
** Partner diversity (for doubles): Try to maximize the variety of partners over the session.
** Promotion and demotion logic: Winners move up, losers move down (classic King of the Court format) -- there can be some leeway in this to achieve other algorithm goals.
** Graceful handling of uneven outcomes: If a player sits out or leaves, the algorithm should rebalance smoothly.
** Deterministic scheduling: Given the same results, it should produce the same next-round assignments.

### Revision 19.1
* Please tune and fix the king of the court algorithm...  If we need for matches to finish before we can determine the next
    round, make sure we add support for that logic.

### Revision 20
* When I start a King of the Court match, my courts just sit there "Waiting for Players..." Something isn't working right... Also, it says "Queue is only available for Round-Robin mode... But there should be a queue for king of the court, it's just not 100% predetermined.

### Revision 20.1
* After I input all the scores, I have to click "Start Next Round" --- Can we have it automatically start the next round when all the scores are inputted for that round?

### Revision 21
* Teams is considered a game mode, but really you can have Team Round Robin and Team King of the Court. Rework Team logic, make sure you can add 2 players as a team when doing Team Round Robin or Team King of the Court --- If algorithm reuse for round robin and king of the court is possible, we should try to implement that --- Also, verify all the existing tests work after this change.

### Revision 21.1
* This logic works, but it's clunky... Adding players then making them a team is tedious, When Locked Teams is selected, make it so that we add players as a team (IE Two inputs for players that will be together). -- With this way of working, we don't need players displayed and teams displayed in two different areas, we just need the teams displayed.

### Revision 21.2
* Give me a test function, like "Add 18 Test Players", but instead have it be "Add 9 Teams".

### Revision 22
* Add a current rankings button during a session that ranks all the players from best to worst... First rank players by total number of wins -- handle ties by giving a higher rank to the player with the better average point differential in all their games. 
* Make sure you also write tests for these ranking features.

### Revision 23
* For locked team sessions, make sure the Current Session page shows the locked teams rather than individual players -- The same as it is in the SEssion Setup Page
* For team sessions, A team gets 1st, 2nd, 3rd --- not the individual players -- make sure the ranking component updates to show the team together, not the player.

### Revision 24
* We don't want a player that gets added late to a game to essentially never wait because other people have played 2-3 games already, so it makes the most since that a player that gets added later should have their wait status = the max waited by the person that has waited the most so far + 1. Please implement that. (Also, wait times should apply to teams as a whole in team mode)
* When team mode is enabled, make sure you can dynamically add and remove teams in the active session page. 

### Revision 25
* Please update the favicon to be the tennis/pickleball icon so it shows that way in the browser address bar and window
* Please update the app so that the current state is saved locally in the browsers data -- If a user does a refresh or a hard-refresh, all the current data should stay. Please add a "Clear Current Session Configuration" in the Sessions Control page to be able to purge the local browser data cache for this site.

### Revision 26
* Make "Show Rankings" a Closable Pop-Up window, instead of an element on the page that we have to scroll down to see
* Change the default number of courts to 4 instead of 2

### Revision 26.1
* Also make "Show Statistics" a Closable Pop-Up window like "Show Rankings" is now.

### Revision 26.2
* Move "Show History" next to the "Show Queue" Button. The button Order should be: "Show Queue" "Show History" Show Rankings" "Show Statistics" "Edit Session" "Clear Session Data" "End Session".

### Revision 26.3
* Rename "Edit Session" to "Edit Session Config"

### Revision 27
* Courts elements in the Active Courts box can overflow the screen, and there is no way to scroll if that happens. Either make it scrollable, or make the elements autofit. 

### Revision 27.1
* The problem is when the courts overflow in the screen width, there is now left-right scroll bar. I have no problem with the vertical scrollability.

### Revision 28
* I want to release this as a github page so that anybody can go to the link and use it. Will that work? Or is there is server component that is required? If it works, what changes do I need?

### Revision 29
* Please build comprehensive UI tests that run in a local browser.

### Revision 29.1
* Go ahead and run the UI tests, and fixup any that are broken

### Revision 29.2
* How come all the tests passed, but running npx -y vite@latest didn't work? Should we add a test for basic dev startup?


### Revision 30
* 7 of the Playwright tests failed, are you able to run the tests yourself, get the error output, and fix them?

### Revision 30.1
* Can you write me a simple script that runs all the tests? (E2E, Round Robin, and King of the Court Tests)

### Revision 30.2
* 'npm run test:all' doesn't work, try it yourself and fix any issues with it: npm run test:all

### Revision 30.2
* Excellent, please run and fix all failing tests (including timing tests)

### Revision 30.3
* How do I run the king of the court tests? Also, there are lots of failures with  `npm test run`, fix them please. Especially make sure all the unit tests run and pass for the round-robin and king of the court algorithms.

### Revision 31
* I have now purchased the domain `BetterPickleballSessions.com` -- please make the necessary updates to support this domain. Also, do any necessary App title renaming for Better Pickleball Sessions. 
* Add a single-page-app type navigation bar at the top that allows users to change between session controls for setup, the current active session, a page explaining the different modes and configurations, and an about page. PLease create the missing pages.

### Revision 31.1
* Beautiful, but just a few tiny bugs, when you click start session, the "Active Session" button doesn't become highlighted, the "Setup" button stays highlighted.
** Also, you shouldn't be able to start a session if there is already an active session. 

### Revision 31.2
* When you switch between the tabs, the logic for Hide/Show Queue and Hide/Show history doesn't work properly, it's indicating that it's already being showed, but it's not until you hide and show it again for both the queue and history.
* Review the king of the court algorithm and the Modes & Config description page, does what's described there actually match the algorithm? I don't think the algorithm is about moving up (atleast it shouldn't be), it's about winners playing winners, the court number the game is played on is irrelevant. (atleast that's how it should be)

### Revision 32
* Currently the King of the Court algorithm uses a strict round-based system. All rounds must finish before a new game is scheduled. But that's not really necessary -- we can have more of a continuous flow. Once 2 games finish, or 1 game finishes and we have 2 people waiting, we can immediately schedule the next game because we know who the winners are. Update the king of the court algorithm to be more continuous and less strict round based. Also, make sure you run and fix any tests that rely on this.

### Revision 32.1
* I think you broke king of the court --- now the courts finish all the matches scheduled at the start, and no new matches are ever scheduled, every just shows as waiting to play in the match queue (they're not even properly showing in the "Waiting Players" queue)... Something is wrong.

### Revision 32.2
* Continuous flow works now, but the problem is that we never wait for other courts to finish -- we are always scheduling a game with available players. That means we are not getting enough variation in the games played -- and the same players constantly play each other. We need to keep the big picture when scheduling games, it's OK to wait for 2 courts to finish before scheduling games. This is tricky, please think hard about a good algorithm to achieve this behavior. People who have only won games should probably never play against people who have only lost games. 

### Revision 32.3
* We're still not there yet, if I test this by only finishing games on court 1 with 2 people waiting, and never finish games on court 2,3,4, court 1 will still continuously get populated with games --- causing a lack of match variety. We need to have a court wait for other courts to finish when the same players have played in games with each other more than other players have already.

### Revision 32.4
* I don't think shouldWaitForBetterMatchups is happening, if I test this by only finishing games on court 1 with noone waiting, court 1 is just constantly populated by the same players playing against each other!


### Revision 32.5
* The algorithm has winning players playing with losing players to keep the flow going, that shouldn't happen. We
   need to wait for other courts to finish, and let some player variety kick in!!!!!
* Rework the algorithm to use the current rankings system, people should only ever play games that are close to them in rankings (if there are 18 players, there should only be 9 players that someone can ever play a game with -- IE 50% of the player pool) -- The #1 ranked player should only ever be able to play games with up to the #9 ranked player in an 18 player game. And the #18 ranked player should only ever be able to play games with up to the #10 ranked player. Have hard locks on this rule -- do not immediately schedule games if this condition is not met!!! Of course, we need special handling for players that haven't played any games at all. Add handling so that it prioritizes games with people closely ranked together -- especially if they haven't played together yet. EG, ideally, #16, #17, #18, #19 ranked players play together if possible. We need to also update the ranking so that somebody with a low win rate winning against someone with a low win rate/ranking doesn't push them to the top --- the value of a win needs to be based on some logarithmic function --- not just a straight wins-loss comparison. Please Think extra special about this algorithm, it's imperative that we get it right. Make sure we don't just rush to make games, its OK to wait for better games. 

### Revision 32.6
* Running the dev server fails with an HTML parse5 error, please fix: `npx -y vite@latest`

### Revision 32.7
* The hard lock on players only being able to play within 50% of the player pool by order of rankings is simply not working -- it's immediately scheduling a court after a game finishes regardless of ranking. Please fix!

### Revision 33
* Once we click Start Session, all session configuration options need to become un-editable until the current active session is ended. We should be able to end the current session from the Setup page (please add an "End Session" button there as well). 

### Revision 33.1
* You can still remove players for an active session on the Setup page, but nothing happens --- you shouldn't be able to remove players there when a session is active.
* Please have 2 buttons while a session is active: "End Session and Clear Data", "End Session and Keep Players"

### Revision 33.2
* When you remove a player from the Active Session page, it should also remove the same player from the Setup page, but that doesn't happen now. 

### Revision 34
* In the about page, Add a link to the github repository for this https://github.com/iysaleh/pickleball_session_manager . Mention that it's open source and to report issues, bugs or feature requests there.

### Revision 35
* Adding a player to an active session doesn't add the player to the Session Setup page --- it should. If you end a session but keep the players after adding a player, any players added after the initial setup should be present in the setup page.
* In King of the Court mode, There's an extra waiting players section within the Match Queue -- sometimes players correctly show up there, but not in the "Waiting Players" Area. There shouldn't be a second waiting players section within the Match Queue, "Waiting Players" should be updated with king of the court waiting players logic when another needs to finish before the next games can be scheduled.

### Revision 36
* For king of the court, We can still run into a situation where players that are similarly skilled can continually play games against or with each other... This is no fun. Put a hard cap at playing 1 game with the same players (on the same team) for every (total-players/4) games. We can wait for other courts to finish to get more games (assuming there are other courts). Put the same cap for the against each other portion. (or is there another solution you can think of to make this better?)

### Revision 36.1
* We have too many empty courts at any one time now, and it's possible to make it impossible to meet these new strict match conditions. We need to ease up the requirements.

### Revision 37
* Can we show and sort by the score that's actually being used in king of the court to arrange games in the "Show Rankings" page?

### Revision 38
* In show statistics, games played includes the current game that is not finished. That is not correct. It should only include completed games.

### Revision 39
* In King of the Court, I hate it where we have a game where players A B are against C D, and then the next game is with players A C vs D B ... Please add hard restrictions against back to back games with the same exact players.

### Revision 39.1
* Add a button to export the match history and current matches configuration in a simple text format (also include the current waiting players)

### Revision 39.2
* Look at this match history and current court setup @pickleball-session-11-03-2025-15-00.txt -- Player Ibraheem is against Leslie, even though she has lost every game, and he has won every game! That should never happen!!! Analyze what went wrong with the algorithm and fix it, and then add a manual test to avoid this from ever happening again.

### Revision 39.3
* Look at this match history and current court setup @pickleball-session-11-03-2025-15-05.txt --- Ibraheem is playing with players 14 and 2 again so soon, with just player 9 being new. That's not enough variety. Expand the back-to-back hard matchmaking limitation to prevent 3 of the same players from playing back-to-back as well.

### Revision 40
* Do all of these improvements to the king of the court algorithm also apply to locked teams mode, or do we need updates to support that?

### Revision 41
* Do the Rankings and Statistics been updated for teams so that we see team based information? Or is it still indvidual?

### Revision 41.1
*Look at the team session for @pickleball-session-11-03-2025-15-19.txt , At the start of the session, we had more than enough teams to make a match, but only 2 courts are filled!!! Something is seriously wrong. Fix it, and add a test so it doesn't happen again.

### Revision 42
* The site is no longer functional at https://betterpickleballsessions.com/

### Revision 43
* SEO Optimization

### Revision 44
* With 3 people waiting in the "Players Waiting" queue (IE 19 people in a 4 court setup), you can end up with cases with a small amount of player variety. Augment the king of the court algorithm to occassionally wait for 2 courts to finish even when it can technically schedule a game now, just to increase game matchup variety. Look at how often players 1 & 2 played against each other due to the lack of waiting in this session: @pickleball-session-11-04-2025-13-54.txt --- please minimize this effect.

### Revision 45
* When I click Start Session, the courts are populated in the order that players were added. Add an advanced configuration option that uses a random seed of the players instead. Disable it by default.

### Revision 46
* Please add the current game mode to the Active Session page after the Session Controls label, EG "Session Controls - King of the Court" or "Session Controls - Round Robin"

### Revision 47
* We need to augment both round robin and king of the court modes to keep track of which courts finish... If, for example, the same 2 courts finish twice before the other courts finish once, then we should wait until the other court finishes and then make a court. Every court needs to have an individual mix threshold counter. The waitlist should count as a court (the formula #waitlisted/4 should be used to determine how many courts the waitlist counts as, for example, if we have 8 players on the waitlist, that's 2 courts of diversity.) We need to slowly expand and decrease a variety counter. Keep track of which courts mixed with each courts last -- never mix with the same courts twice in a row, have them wait for another court to open, then mix all 3 courts (making the most balanced games possible).

### Revision 47.1
* Remember to treat the waitlist like a court, put a hard cap on the same courts mixing 2 times in a row.

### Revision TODO
* King of the Court doesn't really make sense for 4 players, but I tried it anyways. After 3 games, there were no more games to play and all 4 players just sat there waiting. Is something wrong with the algorithm? Shouldn't it never end, regardless of the configuration?
* Please add a test for 20 players and make sure the algorithm continues to work for 400 games, make the winners random...








* I want to make a new game mode called "Competetive Variety Matchmaking", we will build the algorithm for this piece by piece. Please build the shell for this new game mode, but since we don't have anything yet for it, it should just never make any courts when a new match is started.
* At the start of Competetive Variety Matchmaking, we just take up to the first numberOfEmptyCourts*4 available players from the waitlist and make those courts.

* The first feature I want to build for competetive variety matchmaking mode is a simple court variety algorithm... Consider each court as an entity, and the wait list as an entity. Courts may never make a game with the same four players that just played on the court (We assume the minimum players using competetive variety matchmaking is 10). After each match finishes, courts must mix with another court or the waitlist -- and we keep track of which courts just mixed with what court. For example, if court 1 finishes, all players must wait until another court (EG court 2) finishes. Then when another court finishes (or there are players in the wait list), 2 players are swapped from each court. If there is only 1 player on the waitlist, that court does not get made (there must be a minimum of 2 players in the waitlist for court mixing with the waitlist to happen). Consider the waitlist as multiple 4 unit groups that get tracked for this variety algorithm separately. EG, if there are 16 players and 2 courts, the waitlist will have 8 players (considered as 2 groups that mix separately for this variety algorithm). In 3+ court situations where there are enough players to fill them, we have a rule that courts may never mix with the same court (and waitlist) back to back. EG if courts 1 & 2 finish, and mix swapping players to fill themselves for the next game. If they finish again, they may not mix again, and players must return to the waitlist after the game finishes, and the court will be unoccupied until another court finishes. Once courts mix with a different court, we reset the court back to back tracking for all courts that had previously been blocked from being made. I'm sure there are some simple scenarios I forgot in writing this, but the overall idea to ensure match variety is there. Please build this feature, thinking comprehensively about what needs to be better for different scenarios.



* We want to build a variety component to competetive variety matchmaking. The first feature I want to build for competetive variety matchmaking mode is a simple variety algorithm... Keep track of each court that a player has last played on. The same 4 players may never make a game together on any court after having just played together. (We assume the minimum players using competetive variety matchmaking is 10). After each match finishes, players must mix with players that played on another court or that haven't played at all -- We must keep track of the courts that players just mixed together with. For example, if court 1 finishes, all players must wait until another court (EG court 2) finishes. Then when another court finishes (or there are players in the wait list), 2 players are swapped from each court. If there is only 1 player on the waitlist, that court does not get made (there must be a minimum of 2 players in the waitlist for mixing with the waitlist to happen). Prefer to mix with players that haven't played on any court yet before mixing with players that have previously played on a court. In 3+ full court situations (12+ players total), we have a rule that courts may never mix with players from the same court back to back. EG if courts 1 & 2 finish, and mix swapping players to fill themselves for the next game and then if they finish again, they may not mix again and the court will be unoccupied until another court finishes (EG court #3, #4, etc). I'm sure there are some simple scenarios I forgot in writing this, but the overall idea to ensure match variety is there. Please build this feature, thinking comprehensively about what needs to be better for different scenarios.



* In situations where we have 3+ active courts, after players from 2 courts mix once, we don't want them to mix again until atleast one other court has finished their session and are waiting.
--- Don't write any documentation


#### Python rework
* Do not write any documenation. writing documentation.
* This UI is atrocious, try to make it nice for the user. We want to draw the courts as rectangles on the active session page with the team members visibly shown on each side, the users in the waitlist need to be documented. When we complete a match, we don't need a success dialog, but we should have a confirm dialog.
* The round robin algorithm is not working right, we have the same player on multiple courts, that can't happen. A player can only be in one place at once -- either on a single court, or on the waitlist.


* The label text on the active session page is white text on a white background, make it white text on a black background so it's visible.
* All 4 courts are drawn with 1 court per row, displayed as a single column. Make it so courts are drawn 2 courts per row.




 > look at @KOC_RANKING_ALGORITHM.md , we want to develop an ELO like matchmaking system as described there for
   competetive variety in the python code @python\competitive_variety.py  -- we want hard caps on how frequently
   people play together -- if there are 12+ players, you should never play with the same person again until 2 games
   have elapsed since you played together. Similarly, you should not play against the same person again unless 1
   game has elapsed since you played together. Top ranked players should only play against the top 50% of players
   (the up/down range for all games made need to be 50% limited) -- of course, provisional players can play up and
   be the exception. Players are only provisional for 2 games.

* We are only working on the python code right now, not the javascript version of the app. Do not write any markdown documentation or summary files. Do not use EOF syntax to write temporary test files, instead just write the test file and run the test separately. Persist the tests. 
* Add a 'Make Court' button that lets you make a court with any of the players on the waitlist on any courts that are not currently occupied.(this should work in all Game Modes)
* Add an "Edit Court" capability that lets you double click a court to change the player orientation, or swap them out with any player on the waitlist. (this should work in all Game Modes)
* Make sure these new capabilities match our existing theme and do not have white text on white backgrounds anywhere. 
* The Competetive Variety and Round Robin algorithms should continue to work normally even if a court is manually made.
* The Export Session feature should export ELO and sort by it.



* When we end a session, keep the history of all the players added so that when New Session is Pressed again, all the players from the previous session are added automatically.
* Instead of "Load Session" for the main screen, have it be "New Session", "Resume Last Session", "New Session with Previous Players" (we are not persisting player rankings or stats for New Session with Previous Players, just the player names)
* When the app is closed or a session is ended, automatically save the session state locally in a file.... "Resume Last Session" should load that file and resume exactly where it left off.

### Revision 3


* Add an individual court timer for every court that starts ticking as soon as a court is made. Draw the court timer to the right of the Score Input boxes. Make sure that it follows the existing dark theme. Store the game duration in the match history. When we export the session results, we should have the duration for each match in the match history displayed. We should also calculate the average duration for all matches played.

* Add individual timers for each player that keeps track of how long they have been on the waitlist. Update the Show Statistics window to include how long each player has waited. Keep the "Waited" counter logic in tact, we are only adding timers here, not changing matchmaking behavior.

* If we have enough players to make a court waiting (4+), and an open court waiting for a match to be made, and all the other courts that have players have been playing for less than 5 minutes so far, make a court even if the existing matchmaking conditions aren't met. 

* I really like the Competetive Variety Matchmaking algorithm as it is now, build a collection of fuzzing tests to make sure that the algorithm behavior stays consistent going forward. The tests should run through about 100 matches aNd account for a variety of different player counts. The results of each iteration and session state should be verified after each match.

* On Windows 10, the main app background and general theme is light, but on Windows 11, everything is dark themed like I expect and want. Can we default to a dark theme for Windows 10 as well?

* We want to add some spacial aspect to the way courts are positioned. When we create a new session, add the ability to control a new feature called "Court Sliding" with possible options "Right to Left", "Left to Right", and "None" -- default to "Right to Left". When a match is finished for a court for right to left, if there is a court to the right of the court with an active game, the game is moved to the left (and vice versa to left to right). Note that the matchmaking algorithms should not change at all for this feature, just what happens when a score is inputted indicating a game is completed. When finishing a game and sliding a match, add an animation with the court ghost sliding over the other court that it's replacing so it's clear to the user that a court slide action is happening.  

* Currently all of our game-modes operate in a continuous flow kind of system, add a round based system that is configured when creating a new session (make sure to update the GUI so users can select Game-Flow: Rounds, Continuous. When a court finishes in a round based system, all users are moved to the waitlist and no match is scheduled. The next match is scheduled only when the "Next Round" button is pressed. There are 2 new buttons to add to the active session window for Round based game-flows, "Next Round" and "Final Round". Next round is disabled when there is an active court -- all courts must finish before a user can press either "Next Round" or "Final Round". When "Next Round" is pressed, the courts are filled according to what the selected algorithm deems is the best. Note that with round based modes, even if there are imbalances in Competetive Variety Matchmaking, we always fill as many courts as possible given how many players and courts there are at the start of a round. All game mode algorithms are as fair as possible with respect to time waited when scheduling the next round. When "Final Round" is pressed for Competetive Variety Matchmaking, the courts are filled by player rankings. The Top #1 and #4 ranked player play against the Top #2 and #3 ranked player on Court 1. The Top #5 and #8 ranked player play against the Top #6 and #7 ranked player, and so on. The bottom ranked players that don't have a court to play on don't play in the final round. 
## Sliding Revisions
* Do not delete test files. Currently we consider the courts from 1 to N, and if court 2 finishes, 2..N will slide up. We need to instead consider the courts a grid with rows  │
│   of courts. As of now, it's hardcoded to a 2 column x N rows of courts... We need to only do sliding at the row level. if court 1 finishes, court 2 slides to court 1, courts    │
│   3..N stay unchanged. If court 3 finishes, court 4 slides to court 3, courts 1 2 and 5..N remain unchanged (assuming there are 5+ courts). If court 2 finishes, we do not slide  │
│   at all. Update our sliding implementation to do row based sliding.
* Update the Active Session GUI display @python/gui.py  so that games that have just started (as determined by having been active for 30 seconds or less) have a green highlight around them so the user can easily identify which new matches have just been scheduled.
* TODO: Forfeit game doesn't work.

* Transform

# Instruction
* We are only working on the python code right now, not the javascript version of the app. Do not write any implementation documentation or summary files in any format (text , markdown). Do not use EOF syntax to write temporary test files, instead just write the test file and run the test separately. Persist the tests. 
* You don't need to cd to the "pickleball_python_rework" directory to run tests or any python code, that is the current working directory you are in. Commands like 'cd "C:\Users\Ibraheem Saleh\Documents\ProjectDevelopment\pickleball_rework_python" && python test_court_dropdowns.py  2>&1' only need the 2nd part: "python test_court_dropdowns.py 2>&1"
* Whenever you change something related to the Competetive Variety Matchmaking algorithm, you always run the fuzzing tests for it:"make run_fuzz_tests").
* Tests built should have a make target added for them in the Makefile (Do not create new makefiles just for new tests, use the existing Makefile). Always run tests from their make targets, do not tail the output of tests that are run, just parse the entire output (or grep for what you care about!)
* Do not prompt me to run the tests, always run the tests without prompting me. Run the tests without the tail command.
* Never run any git tools.


# Announce when courts are made
* When new courts are made, only people looking at the screen can see that event happen. We need to add an audible announcement whenever a new court is made. There should be a way to enable or disable this feature in the Active Session window (by toggling a sound icon). Whenever a new court is made, a text to voice reader should announce: <*announcement noise plays first 1-2s> "New Match Ready on Court <courtName>, Team <Player1> And <Player2> versus <Player3> And <Player4>.
* The court name needs to be taken from the court name label --- someone can change a court name, even if it has an internal court number.
* If multiple courts are made at the same time, they overlap and are unable to be understood. Make any played announcements play one after the other. 
* The announcment sound needs to be stored locally so it works cross platform, and the current beep is too gentle, get a stringer beep noise.
* Remove all reliance on system sounds, EG sound files with the path "/System/Library/Sounds" --- this feature needs to work cross platform on windows and linux as well.
* The slide action announces a new court, but that's not a new court. We do not need to announce when a court slides.

# Teams Feature
* Some players only want to play together with one other person through the entire session, they do not want random teammates. Update the New Session dialog to support locking players together (IE Player Partnerships). Also Add a Manage Player Locks button on the Active session page to lock players together. Note that players locked together can still be manually swapped in the edit court dialog -- locks are only considered at matchmaking. Update the round-robin and competetive variety matchmaking algorithms to consider player locks. Also, we need to add support for player partnership bans -- players that do not ever want to play together. The controls for locks and bans should be similarly located as they are related. When scheduling matches with locked players, they should always be on the same team. Try to not ruin any of the algorithms by adding support for these locks. The fuzzing tests for when the locks don't exist should still pass!!!!
## Revisions:
* Instead of the Button being called "Manage Locks Bans", have the label say "Manage Partnerships & Bans".
* When adding a partnership, the dropdowns allow you to click "Player 1" and "Player 1", have the dropdown logic be smarter so you can't select a player to partner with themselves.
* If you add a partnership, you should not be able to select either of the two players in the partnership to create another lock.


#Forfeit Feature:
* If you forfeit a match, the same exact players get immediately scheduled on the same court with the same configuration. That's not what should happen, instead that matchup should be skipped and   │
│   not played until other matches have passed.                                                                                                                                                           │
│   * If you add or remove a player, the same 2 people who were just on a team together are often placed in another game being on the same team together -- see @pickleball_session_20251126_113424.txt   │
│   -- Bob Smith and Kate Beckinsale are on the same team together again after having just played a game. The parternship variety rules seem to not work in the event that a player is added/removed mid  │
│   session. Fix the logic here so that it makes more sense.                                                                                                                                              │
│   * The above situations are mostly talking about competetive variety matchmaking, but it could also apply to round robin.
#Revisions
* If you remove a player on an active court, the Match History becomes cleared (show statistics still shows the games that were played)
* If you remove a player mid-session, they should still show up in statistics, and the Export Session results.
* We also get this exception in console:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/ibraheem.saleh/dev/pickleball/python/gui.py", line 1347, in refresh_display
    team1_str = ", ".join(team1_names)

# Dynamic competetiveness feature:
*We need to be more relaxed depending on waitlist size!!!! If the waitlist has 0 or 1 players on it, we need the roaming range bracked requirement to be more relaxed -- IE 65% instead of 50%... If 2, 3, 4 or more are on the waitlist, we need to be more strict!!!
** Implement a UI slider for competetive variety matchmaking on the active session UI to control the competetiveness. It should be located to the left of the "toggle voice announcements" button. There should be 4 positions for it -- Casual, Semi-Competitive, Competetive, Ultra-Competetive, Custom. When casual, is set, roaming range percent = 100. When semi-competetive is set, roaming range percent is set to 65. When Competetive is set, roaming range is set to 50, when ultra-competetive is set, roaming range is set to 35 and opponent and partnership repetition limits are both set to 1. When custom is clicked, a dialog pops up letting the user set the roaming range, partnership, and opponent repetition parameters. -- 
** When the slider is moved, the competetive variety matchmaking algorithm should immediately re-evaluate if it can make any new matches given the condition changes, and use those changed conditions going forward.
** By default when creating a session, if there are 2,3,4 or more people on the waitlist, default to the competetive setting. If there are 0 or 1 people on the waitlist, default to semi-competetive. You know the waitlist size by doing the math: total-players modulo 4, and also taking into account the number of active courts (EG if there are 4 courts, and 24 players, the waitlist is 8 because you can only occupy 16 players at a time due to the number of court constraints). 
* Update custom so that it's not a position on the slider, rather if you double click the "Competitiveness" Label, the dialog to set custom settings pops up. If a user confirms custom settings, the blue slider circle should just disappear.
* Add a "Show Rank" button to the right of the "Show Time Waited" button and styled the same. When pressed, the player rank appears in parenthesis to the right of the player name, EG: "Peter Parker [14]" "Iris West [2]"
* Update "Show Rank" to also add the ranks on the active courts when toggled.
* It appears that there is a bug where moving the competetiveness slider does not reevaluate whether a current match can be made... Verify that that code is actually in place.
* Add a slider for "Variety" that controls the opponent and partnership repetition constraints. It should have the levels "min" "balanced" "max", at "min", the partnership and opponent constraints are set to 1,1. At Balanced, we get what we have now, 3,2. and at Max, we get 4,3. This should also support clicking the "Variety" label to set a custom value for this parameter, similar to clicking the "Competetiveness" label. Make sure to re-evaluate the court situation and whether we can make a new court once the variety slider is moved.
* Remove the fact that setting competetiveness to "Ultra-Competetive" changes the partnership and opponent repetition parameters, it should only edit the roaming range percentage.
* In custom variety settings dialog, let me set the partnership and opponent parameters to 0 (right now it only lets me set it to 1).
* I set custom variety to 0-0, and mode to casual -- which should immediately make a court if there are 4 players available, and no court was made. Clearly The court evaluation is not happening when competetive or variety sliders are moved. They are only happening when a match finishes. 
* Editing the custom "Competetiveness" dialog still has variety settings, but we've moved that logic to it's own variety slider. Update the dialog to only have the roaming range option (and also update us to set it to whatever percent of the current player pool gives us 4 players (EG if 16 players, 25% is 4 players). 
* Add a reset button to the custom dialog that allows us to bring back the old sliders and resets them to the default.
* The custom Variety dialog also needs a similar "Reset to Default" feature.
* Update the custom variety dialog to set the minimum roaming percentage to the smallest percent of the current player pool that gives us 4 players -- for example, if it's 16 players, 25% gets us 4 players. If it's 18 players, it's 23% (make sure you round up!)
* Roaming range can still go to 0% when there 16 players, the minimum should be 25%!
* In the custom competetiveness dialog, the minimum settable value for roaming players needs to be the percentage that gets 4 players -- The roaming range slider should only go from minimum settable value to 100%, not 0 to 100% like it does now.
* Roaming range should NOT appear on the custom variety dialog!
* Bug: Competetiveness roaming range is set to 25%, at max with 16 players, nobody should be able to play with or against anyone not within 4 ranks of themselves, and yet in @pickleball_session_20251214_213217.txt Leo (Rank #2) played with Eve (Rank #8) --- something isn't working there -- The only players he should've been allows to play with are ranks #1, #3, #4, #5, #6.
* Remember, the roaming rank range applies in both directions! If you're rank #2 in a 16 player game with a 25% roaming range, you can play with 25% above, and 25% below you!
* Matches are still being scheduled while violating the roaming range -- something isn't working. 
* Changing the competetiveness slider is not filling empty courts. Also, update the "Casual" competetiveness setting to be 80% roaming range.
* Refactor the competetiveness and variety logic to be profiles, make it easy to adjust and change which profile we use depending on different conditions (EG, like we do now depending on the waitlist size) --- reset it so that if we have 0, 2, 3, or 4+ on the waitlist, we default to competetive mode. If we have 1 on the waitlist, we deafult to semi-competetive.
* partner_repetition_limit and opponent_repetition_limit are part of the variety constraints and need to be separate profile objects from competetiveness constraints.
* If you click someones name on the waitlist or a match in the match history, after the timer ticks 1 second, the selection clears... This is tedious, make it so that the selected element persists past the timer ticks in the active session page.
* You can now have an item selected in both the Waitlist and Match History at the same time, you should only ever be able to select a single item in any pane.
* Now if you select something in Match History, and then select something in the Waitlist, it automatically jumps back to the match history selection after the timer ticks. Also, make it so that if you select something, then click it again, it deselects the item.
* Now when you select an item in either the Waitlist or Match History, it does not appear to have the blue highlight anymore, making it unclear to the user that the item is selected at all.
* The clicking behavior for selection is very unreliable, sometimes it takes 4 clicks to select an item and have it highlighted.
* Instead of using the waitlist size to determine default constraints, use the total players. If we have 13 or less players, set the default competetiveness to Casual. If we have 14 or more players, set the default competetiveness to Competetive.
* Instead of using the waitlist size to determine default constraints, use the total players. If we have 13 or less players, set the default competetiveness to Casual. If we have 14 players, set the default competetiveness to semi-competetive. If we have 15 players, set it to competetive. If we have 16 or 17 players, set it to Casual.  If we have 18 or more players, set it to competetive.


# Easy state reset
* We need to make it easier to track state and go back in time if we choose. Every time a match finishes, store all the necessary state to be able to load the session at that state. If you double click a match in the match history, an "Edit Match Score" pops up -- Instead of just "Save" "Cancel" options, add an option, "Load" which when clicked will load the active session to exactly right before this match was finished. Be careful about your implementation here, make sure any sneaky variables or state that also need to be updated get updated.
* BUG: If a court slide action happens, and a historic match is loaded, the slide action needs to be undone and both the court needs to be set to the original position.
* Scratch this -- seems I was wrong: Bug: When loading a match session from the history, it seems like player variety parameters aren't reset/reloaded, preventing matches from being made that should be made after the loaded match is finished.

* Instructions Button
* Add an "Instructions" button on the active session window. When clicked, it opens an informational dialog with title "Instructions" and bullet points as follows: 
-"Continuous flow mode, not rounds based. There are no timers or rally-scoring, finish your games normally."
-"The computer will tell you where to go. When you finish your game, input your scores and confirm them. You will either be placed in a new game right away or be put on the waitlist and have to wait for another game to finish."
-"When you finish a match on a deep court, and a game is still being played on a shallow court, wait for the point to finish and then have the shallow court slide to your deep court to finish uninterrupted."
-"Red means wall, Blue is net".
-"This is a competetive-variety matchmaking algorithm. The first 2 games are provisional and random, and then it will start to place people in matches according to current performance metrics (wins-losses, point differentials, previous opponents)"

# First bye
* Sometimes when you start a new session, some people need the first bye -- assuming there are people that are going to be on the waitlist, they will be skipped when creating the first matches and guaranteed to not be in the first game. Add a "Manage Byes" button to the Session Setup dialog which pops up a new dialog that lets a user add players to a list to be the first bye. Note that this only works if there are actually people that will be waiting at the start.
* Carrie and Ibraheem were the first bye, the first match finished, and they weren't immediately used to make a court, but they should have been. There's a bug where the first bye logic waits for 2 games to finish before 1st bye players are scheduled for a match, that isn't the right behavior. First bye players should be scheduled for a game as soon as the first match finishes.
* When creating a new session with previous players, have the first bye players saved.
* In session setup, when there are more byes than there should be (for example, if there is 1 court, 6 players, there should only be 2 first byes max), do not let the session be made, have a warning dialog preventing the session from starting until the user removes a player from the first bye list and has a valid number of byes less than or equal to the maximum number of allowed byes specified.
* look at @pickleball_session_20251217_122724.txt , the first game ended, and the first byes are still waiting, per the algorithm, the first byes should be scheduled if it was working properly.
* When starting a new session with previous players, the restored first byes look like "player_14_1766003207.921782" --- that's not right. The new session with previous players first byes should properly add the players from the new session with the same name as before (probably by doing string matching based on the name).
* Look at @pickleball_session_20251217_123120.txt , the same bug as before exists --  the first game ended, and the first byes are still waiting, per the algorithm, the first byes should be scheduled if it was working properly. Think hard and deep about why this bug is happening, and come up with a comprehensive solution that is simple to understand and is coded intelligently and human readably.
* The "Too many courts for N players" validation is unnecessary. It's OK to have more courts than needed for the number of players we have.
* [Bug] When I created a 15 player match on 4 courts and added 2 players to the first byes list, only 1 of those two players was actually on the first bye!!! Figure out what caused this and fix it. Be precise in your fix, and assume the role of a staff level export developer
* You have made it so that you can have more byes than would be on the waitlist --- in a 15 player 4 court scenario, there should only be allowed 3 byes. Restore the warning message that prevents more byes than are waiting.

# Matchmaking bug
* [Bug] Look at @pickleball_session_20251217_173236.txt -- with competetiveness set to Casual, it made the match Ibraheem/Carol vs Alisha/Kimberly... Having thos players is fine, but it's not balanced at all. It should have been Ibraheem/Alisha vs Carol/Kimberly if it was going to make any match with those players. Investigate why matches that are made aren't being balanced. Be precise in your fix, and assume the role of a staff level export developer.

# Time Waited Rework
* We need to rework the times_waited logic -- the counter is not a good enough measure of keeping track of who has waited a long period of time. Instead, we need to look at the total time actually waited for each player and prioritize making match configurations that result in players that have waited the most already not waiting more. We need a threshold at which point the algorithm is not picky to make people wait -- EG, if 15 players are all within 2 minutes of waiting, the algorithm should not care about who waits... But if 13 players are all within 2 minutes of the same total time waited, but 2 other players are within 15 minutes, then make sure those 2 other players that have already waited a lot longer are not put on the waitlist and are prioritized in getting the next available match. This is an extremely complex rework that may have ramifications not described here, be smart in how you will go about this rework and consider other parts of the code where this may effect things. Be precise in your rework, and assume the role of a staff level export developer. Create code that is extensible and maintanable, with logical structure.
* Please verify that the thresholds are based on the time someone waited against the time that the person that waited the least has waited.
* The relative thresholds need to be based on hard time specifications, not gaps like 3x/5x. It needs to be something like a 12 minute gap between the least waited person should mean a waitlisted person should have priority, and a 20 minute gap means extreme priority.
* Here are the github copilot AI reviewed suggestions for this time waited rework, decide if they are correct and should be implemented. The full feature patch for this is in @timeWaitedRework.patch :
===
* In @python/wait_priority.py ; The reverse parameter is not being used correctly. Line 226 returns result if not reverse else result, which always returns the same value regardless of the reverse parameter. This should be result if not reverse else result[::-1] or the logic needs to be corrected to actually reverse the list when reverse is True.
* In @python/wait_priority.py ; The documentation mentions "Dynamic thresholds" but the implementation actually uses fixed time gaps (120s, 720s, 1200s) from the shortest waiter, not dynamic thresholds. Consider updating the documentation to say "Relative thresholds based on fixed time gaps" or "Gap-based thresholds" to more accurately describe the implementation.
* In @test_wait_priority_integration.py ; Variable min_wait is not used.
* In @python/gui.py ; This assignment to 'stats' is unnecessary as it is redefined before this value is used.


# Relative Times update
* Update all the timers to use relative timing instead of times based on the system clock. If I end a session and then resume it, all of the clocks should resume exactly where they left off. If I load a session at some point, all the times should load to exactly what they were before.
* Add support for a --test flag that when set at program start causes the timer to accelerate by 15 seconds for every second, that way we can better test wait prioritization. 
=
* If we resume a session after ending it, all the wait times show as negative. We need to be able to resume a session with the timers exactly where they left off and continue incrementing them normally.
* When we resume a session, the game duration timers still show as negative, that hasn't been fixed yet.

# Tweaks 12-21-2025
* When making the first match, we need to randomly spread the players on the court that are not specified on the first bye list, it should not be consistent between runs but it currently is. 
*  You broke something, in a 20 player 4 court scenario with 2 on the first bye list, the 4th court isn't being populated sometimes, but sometimes it is --- it's inconsistent...
* Explain the reason for artifically limiting the candidate pool, what does having this logic do for our matchmaking algorithm?
* Right now, the courts render on the active courts page as a giant green box, with a division line, and then the side box, and then the team box within the side box and the names drawn within the team box. That is wasted space. Remove the inner team box and just have the side box, and then expand the names to auto fill the entire side box.
** Good, but the names are still not taking up the entire box, is it possible to auto size the text to fill the entire box on the screen?
* When a user renames a court name, and then ends the session and starts a brand new one, they need to rename the court name every time. Persist court names between sessions so long as the number of courts is the same.

# Adaptive Balance
* Even after many games, we still get a lot of imbalanced matches -- a lot of the time it's because of the variety constraints. Analyze the competetive variety matchmaking algorithm. How can we adjust it as the session goes on to get more balanced matches?
* By relaxing Roaming Range, you're lowering the quality of the games. That's bad. We want more balanced matches at higher levels.
* We never want to relax the partnership and opponent constraints to 0 -- at max they should go down to 1.
* The problem is completed matches before relaxation happens is hardcoded to 15, 30, etc... It needs to be dynamic based on the number of players and the number of games they have played. We have 2 provisional matches, then all players should play 2 more (on average) before we start relaxing to the first mid level. Then 2 more again before we relax to the late level.
* Add an adaptive constraints slider like we have for competetiveness and variety. It should automatically change as the match progresses (indicating where we are in adapting the constraints)
* Update @CLAUDE.md documenting the adaptive constraints system.
* I don't understand the adaptive balance slider, it goes from AUTO to MAX, and then says Manual: 8.0x at the bottom... How do I set it to auto and have it take over? Shouldn't it go from NONE to MAX? When it adjusts variety constraints, should the variety slider stay put or change?
* I can go from None/Disabled to Manual, but I don't have an easy way to toggle Auto. Add a state button below it that I can click that changes between Disabled, Auto, Manual, then the slider can be moved depending on the state.
* The states are now Disabled and Manual -- there is no Auto!
* You misunderstood me, I want there to be an auto state for the adaptive balance system (and that should be default) -- we need to add the auto state.
* When I click the state button, it only cycles through Disabled and Manual. It seems like Auto is bugged and doesn't toggle.
* *As auto changes and the match progresses, the slider doesn't move. But the slider should automatically move when the state changes.
* We are working on the adaptive balance feature, see @adaptiveRelaxation.patch ... the problem is, we still get somewhat imbalanced matches with the relaxation in place. As we relax variety constraints, should we not also add balance constraints? Assume the role of a staff level export developer and pickleball match expert with years and years of observing sessions... How would we smartly enforce balance constraints to get better matches as a session goes along? Implement that feature smartly.
* Elite+Weak matches are undesirable... We want Elite vs Elite, Elite Vs Strong, Strong vs Average, Average vs Weak, Weak Vs Weak.
* Remember, these balance constraints should only take effect once the adaptive balance system kicks in (after around round 4)

=======================
Look at @pickleball_session_20251218_191723.txt -- Ibraheem Saleh, Patrick Carroll: 11 beat Robert Dillon, SKyler
   Hensley: 0 and Ibraheem Saleh, David Laforest: 11 beat Ellie Farias, Sheila B.: 5 -- That is NOT how the balance
   should have been made!! Roaming range was set to 100%, so anyone could play with anyone. Ibraheem should have
   been with Sheila and David witih Ellie (given the balanced variety setting)!!! The @python/competitive_variety.py
    algorithm is clearly NOT balancing matches that are being made properly. Investigate why matches that are made
   aren't being balanced. Be precise in your fix, and assume the role of a staff level export developer.

# TODO 

*Make sure first 2 provisional matches are ACTUALLY RANDOM -- not just using the list!
*Add Rounds Mode
*Fix bug where going from 15 to 16 people never utilizes the 4th court!
*With no waitlisted players (or 1 waitlisted player), we need to be more lax about making courts (like it is now). --- TBD 
*Add a clickable button with instructions (so I can just read them, instead of remembering!)
*Add NxM grid support for setup
*Add ability to disable broken courts 
*Add Team Competetive Variety Mode
*Add Team Support for people that want to play together for Regular Competetive Variety (BE CAREFUL NOT TO BREAK THE ALGO!!!)
*Add singles support
