Edit Court Dialog - Dropdown UI Improvements
=============================================

CHANGES MADE:

1. **Edit Court Match Dialog (edit_court_match method)**
   
   BEFORE: Used multi-selection list widgets (QListWidget with MultiSelection)
   - Team 1 Players: Multi-select list
   - Team 2 Players: Multi-select list
   - Users clicked items to select/deselect
   
   AFTER: Uses dropdown menus (QComboBox) with auto-swap
   - Team 1 Position 1: Dropdown
   - Team 1 Position 2: Dropdown (for doubles)
   - Team 2 Position 1: Dropdown
   - Team 2 Position 2: Dropdown (for doubles)
   
   KEY FEATURES:
   - Each player position has its own dropdown
   - Auto-swap: When selecting a player from another team, they automatically swap positions
   - Sorted player list for easier selection
   - Works for both singles and doubles modes
   - Swap Teams button to swap all positions at once

2. **Make Court Dialog (make_court method)**
   
   BEFORE: Used multi-selection list widgets
   - Team 1 Players: Multi-select list
   - Team 2 Players: Multi-select list
   
   AFTER: Uses dropdown menus with auto-swap
   - Same structure as Edit Court for consistency
   - Position-based dropdowns
   - Auto-swap on duplicate selection
   - Adapts to singles/doubles mode

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

Auto-Swap Logic:
- When a player is selected in a position, the system checks if they're already selected elsewhere
- If a duplicate is found, the combo boxes swap values
- Previous position value is stored in position_dict
- Prevents users from selecting the same player in multiple positions
- Uses blockSignals(True/False) to prevent infinite loops during swaps

Position Dictionary:
- Tracks current selections: {('team1', 0): player_id, ('team1', 1): player_id, ...}
- Updated whenever combo box selection changes
- Used for swap detection and auto-swap implementation

Benefits Over Multi-Select Lists:
1. Clearer UI: Each position explicitly labeled (Position 1, Position 2)
2. Automatic validation: Can't accidentally select same player twice
3. Better UX: Auto-swap feels more natural than manual deselection
4. Works for both singles and doubles
5. Easier to understand player positioning

TEST COVERAGE:

Created 3 comprehensive test files:
1. test_court_dropdowns.py - Basic UI functionality
2. test_ui_dropdowns.py - Detailed UI improvements verification
3. test_auto_swap_behavior.py - Auto-swap logic documentation and testing

All tests pass successfully and existing tests (test_court_management.py) still pass.

FILE MODIFIED:
- python/gui.py (1000+ lines of UI improvement)

Lines changed:
- make_court() method: ~170 lines (from list widgets to dropdowns)
- edit_court_match() method: ~270 lines (from list widgets to dropdowns + auto-swap)
